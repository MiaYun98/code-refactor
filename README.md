# code-refactor

## UW Bootcamp Module 1 challenge. 

This is the first challenge that we are doing in the course. 

### Task 

Fixing the code in the index.html and style.css file to work and more visible to the people. 
Also make it to have less repeating code to work. 

## User Story 

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

### Method & Resource

All the changes are based on the lecture that we've done in the class
They are moslty related to the topic we've touched
Searched up some code through the search engines
The link that I used for the research : 
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40351323/what-does-a-attribute-do-in-html
* https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.ASP
* https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp

## Working Process
### HTML 

First they didn't have a alt="" for the image file they put it so I added the discriptions for all the image lines
Changed the title from website --> Horison Homepage

### CSS

There are some repeating lines in the code so combined into one
Also because I combined all the repeating lines, they are not finding the part cause of the missing id so added the id at the bottom for the search
